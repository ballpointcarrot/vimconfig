vimconfig

My personal, portable vim configuration.
Inspired by the plugin synchronizing screencast at vimcasts.org

Installation

---

I hope to have some form of automated installation at some point. 
For now, copy colors/ folder to the ~/.vim/ directory, .vimrc and .gvimrc to the ~/ directory. Any plugins should be cloned as necessary (via git submodule update), and installed by either copying the plugin's script to the ~/.vim/plugin/ folder, or running the associated makefile/rakefile.
