My personal, portable vim configuration.
Inspired by the plugin synchronizing screencast at vimcasts.org

Installation

---

I hope to have some form of automated installation at some point. for now, copy the .vim/ directory, .vimrc and .gvimrc to the home directory, Create a colors directory within .vim, and move tir_black.vim into the .vim/colors directory.
